## Contributing

Contributions from community are key to make NodeGoat a high quality comprehensive resource. Lets make NodeGoat awesome together!

### Ways to Contribute
Depending on your preference, you can contribute in various ways. Here are tasks planned for [upcoming release](https://github.com/OWASP/NodeGoat/milestones).
You can also open an issue, sending a PR, or get in touch on [Gitter Chat](https://gitter.im/OWASP/NodeGoat) or [Slack](https://owasp.slack.com/messages/project-nodegoat/)

If sending PR, once code is ready to commit, run:
```
npm run precommit
```
This command uses `js-beautifier` to indent the code and verifies these [coding standards](https://github.com/OWASP/NodeGoat/blob/master/.jshintrc) using `jsHint`. Please resolve all `jsHint` errors before committing the code.
